## What's Dapper Transaction?
Dapper Transaction is exactly like Dapper but extend the IDbTransaction interface instead and use Dapper under the hood.

It's a simple library to make it easier to work with a transaction.

Everything Dapper support, Dapper Transaction support it as well (It's only new extension method calling Dapper)

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(FiddleHelper.GetConnectionStringSqlServerW3Schools()))
{
	connection.Open();
	
	using (var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())
	{
		// Dapper
		var affectedRows1 = connection.Execute(sql, new {CustomerName = "Mark"}, transaction: transaction);
		
		// Dapper Transaction
		var affectedRows2 = transaction.Execute(sql, new {CustomerName = "Mark"});

		transaction.Commit();
	}
}
```

You want to help us? 
Your donation directly helps us maintaining and growing ZZZ Free Projects. We canâ€™t thank you enough for your support.

### Why should I contribute to this free & open source library?
We all love free and open source libraries!
But there is a catch! Nothing is free in this world.
Contributions allow us to spend more of our time on: Bug Fix, Content Writing, Development and Support.

We NEED your help. Last year alone, we spent over **3000 hours** maintaining all our open source libraries.

### How much should I contribute?
Any amount is much appreciated. All our libraries together have more than 100 million downloads, if everyone could contribute a tiny amount, it would help us to make the .NET community a better place to code!

Another great free way to contribute is  **spreading the word** about the library!
 
A **HUGE THANKS** for your help.
